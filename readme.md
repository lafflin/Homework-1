## Overview
This weeks challenge was to refactor the given code.
​
### The challenge

​Refactor the code to make it more accessible by using semantic HTML elements. Alongside this cleaning up the CSS to make it cleaner

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines​
```

### Acceptance Criteria
​
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## My process
​
1. First I started with adding alt attributes to all the images in the HTML and cleaned up some of the CSS by combining some repeating class selectors.
2. I added semantic HTML elements and continued working on cleaning the CSS up. During this the header image (#hero) broke.
3. While I worked to better the Semantic HTML I also changed many of the non-repeating classes to id's.
4. In order to fix the top image, I first undid some of my CSS changes to get it to function normally, but after my session with my tutor, I was able to find a clean way to fix the issue in the least lines possible.
5. The final thing I did was make a README


### Built with
​
- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

- I learned a lot about how to better use Semantic HTML elements, and when to best use specific ones.
- I learned about the CSS point system, as well as how to organize my code efficiently, using DRY as a guiding principle
- I learned markdown through the process of making this file, with help from our TA Scott and my tutor Sachin.

### Continued development

- The number one thing I need to work on more would be CSS. It can be difficult for me to visualize what will happen when I write code, meaning I need to simply spend more time working on CSS to get a better grasp on it.
- Another thing I need some work on is markdown, but I am confident that given time and repetition I will pick it up easily.

### Useful resources
- [For Semantic HTML](https://medium.com/@zac_heisey/7-alternatives-to-the-div-html-tag-7c888c7b5036) - This helped me mainly because it simply listed many of the Semantic HTML elements with small descriptions, making it perfect to help with replacing the divs in the assignment.
- [For the README](https://www.makeareadme.com/#acknowledgments) - This tool that my tutor gave to me was instrumental in creating my README, allowing me to quickly see what I was typing rendered in markdown. Will definetely continue using this in the future.
